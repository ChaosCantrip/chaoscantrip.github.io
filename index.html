                <p>I'm an <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/electrical-engineering-department/electronic-information-meng/" target="_blank">
                    Electrical Engineering</a> student at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Imperial College
                    London</a>.
                    I started programming when I was young, and have started trying to make my way in a career as a
                    Software
                    Engineer.</p>
                <p>My Dad has the sole claim to responsibility when it comes to my love of programming. Back when I was
                    6,
                    he took me to the <a href="https://www.thebigbang.org.uk/" target="_blank">Big Bang Fair</a>, in Birmingham. At that
                    event, there was a stall for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> teaching basic
                    HTML.
                    That day, I went home, and burned my way through the entire course, learning HTML, CSS and
                    Javascript,
                    and I fell in love with programming forever.</p>
                <p>Shortly after that, he got me a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> for
                    Christmas,
                    and a copy of <a href="https://simonmonk.org/programming-raspberry-pi-ed2/" target="_blank">PROGRAMMING

                    learnt to
                    program in Python, and finally got my first taste of real code development.</p>

                    <p>SharkBot was my first large project.</p>
                    <p>Utilising Python, and the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">discord.py</a> library,
                        I built a bot to serve the Discord Server me and my friends use. Originally built to keep track
                        of a <i>#count-to-1000</i> channel we had going, it fast became my new hobby, adding more
                        features and content as fast as we could come up with it.</p>
                    <p>Now, it has a plethora of features, from admin features to help us run the server to (free)
                        lootboxes and an ever-expanding item collection game. More info can be found soon at <a href="https://sharkbot.online" target="_blank">SharkBot Online</a>, though that website is still a work in progress.</p>
                    <p>Until recently, SharkBot was hosted by myself, running from
                        a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> quite
                        literally scotch taped to my bedroom wall. Unfortunately, I have moved house, and due to
                        network reliability issues, this solution wasn't working as well so he now runs on an AWS EC2 Instance.
                        Changes to the code are uploaded to GitHub, and the bot automatically fetches and applies them when needed.</p>
